About GlassMeds
GlassMeds was built to increase medical assistance transparency, offering insights into the patient experience with facilitites (hospital / clinics) acrross the US. All of the information you see here was shared by people who went trhough the procedures themselves, and ended up with a "surprise" bill at the end.
